# swap
```
for i=0:N
    P[i] = i

for k=0:K
   for i=0:M
      do_swap(P, L[i], R[i])   
for i=0:N
    print P[i]   
```
So the whole thing is O(K*M*N)
```
do_swap(P, l, r) {
   for i=l:r+1   // O(N)
       j = (l+r-i)
       if (j<=i) break       
       t = P[i]
       P[i] = P[j]
       P[j] = t
}
```
Pre-calc Q[N] as the result of M-loop
```
for i=0:M
    do_swap(Q, L[i], R[i])
/* Q[i] : ith -> Q[i] */    
for k=0:K
   for i=0:N
       P[Q[i]] = P[i]
```   

--> O(KN)

* for tests 6-10, even O(K) will time out
  * There must be cycles along the K iteration
     1. get cycle
     2. K -> K % cycle
* Two potential cycles
  1. the whole permutation cycle    
      `for i=0:N : if all(P[i] == i)`
         
  2. For each P[i], find cycles[i]
      `for i=0:N, k=K%cycles[i], -> O(k)`

# Triangles

* The very bronze way
```
   for each triplet
       check and sum
```
O(N^3) --> works for case 2

* Iterate all the right corner points O(N) * O(N)
```
x

x
x x   x  x
```
--> Sum(d_x[i]) * Sum(d_y[i])  --> this is the key to avoid O(N2) -> O(N) --> A corner since it depends on your algebra skill
Need prepare a list of each points that have the same x or y coordinates -> O(N)
```
for i=0:N
   Xlist[X[i]].insert(i)
   Ylist[Y[i]].insert(i)
```
for i=0:N
   foreach x in xlist[X[i]]
      sum_x
   foreach y in ylist[Y[i]]
      sum_y
   area += (sum_x * sum_y) 
   area %= (10^9+7)
```
* For each Xlist, it is the same set of points with an offset in sum
* if you cache sum_x[i], do O(1) offset  --> O(N)

# Clocktree
* It's a tree --> backtracking + simple case work
* The understanding is hard

Key insights:
   * EQUIVALENT trees
   * Normalize the trees into a canonical form -> All nodes are 0, with root a final count
   * Case work
       * 0 --> round trip -> N
       * 1 --> 
          * Another clue need undestand is All odd and all even are equivalent
