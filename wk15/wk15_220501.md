# 2202 prob1 -- Redistributing gifts

Permutation Swapping prob.

cow i , he can exchange with cow Pi [0..i]

```
for i=0:N
    solve(i)
```    
i <- (j1, j2) 
j1 <- (k1, k2)
k1 <-.. <- i

==> Graph problem --> use Back tracking !

```
for j=0:i+1
   # it's backtracking with i, j
   if (j == i) then i is the answer, return
   # Here is the backtracking
   stack.push_back(P[i][j])
   while stack.size()>0
       stack.pop -> i_cur
       foreach edge_of_i_curr as k
           if k == i
               Booya -> return ans[i] = j
           if not in cache
               stack.push_back(k)
                    
```
# prob 2 robot instructions 
N items, each item can be included or excluded --> 2^N --> 2^10 ~ 1k, 2^20 ~10^6, beyond-> time out
2^20 + 2^20
```
foreach combination of first 20 items
```
```
for i=1:2^20

```
