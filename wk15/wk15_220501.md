# 2202 prob1 -- Redistributing gifts

Permutation Swapping prob.

cow i , he can exchange with cow Pi [0..i]

```
for i=0:N
    solve(i)
```    
i <- (j1, j2) 
j1 <- (k1, k2)
k1 <-.. <- i

==> Graph problem --> use Back tracking !

```
for j=0:i+1
   # it's backtracking with i, j
   if (j == i) then i is the answer, return
   # Here is the backtracking
   stack.push_back(P[i][j])
   while stack.size()>0
       stack.pop -> i_cur
       foreach edge_of_i_curr as k
           if k == i
               Booya -> return ans[i] = j
           if not in cache
               stack.push_back(k)
                    
```
# prob 2 robot instructions 
N items, each item can be included or excluded --> 2^N --> 2^10 ~ 1k, 2^20 ~10^6, beyond-> time out
2^20 + 2^20
```
foreach combination of first 20 items
    /* got x_sum, y_sum, bits */
    if there is a remaining combination of (Xg-x_sum, Yg-y_sum), just add the counts together
     
```
```
for i=1:2^20
   /* calc the x_sum and y_sum of chosen combinations */
   for j=0:21
       if ((i>>j)&1)
           jth item is chosend
           sum += item
           bits++
       else
           not chosen
   /* got x_sum, y_sum, bits */        
```

5 --> 101
6 --> 110

# prob 3 - Email filing
Straight simultions, it's a messy simulation

* The simulation is to keep a few states
    * folder view: top folder index
    * Mail view: i_N, i_N2
    * Each mail need a state -- whether it is filed
    * Filing: 1 state flip, count[mailbox]--

* Folder list, i_M ... i_M+K
    ** The only when to scroll down folders is when when count[i_M] is 0
```
while 1
    if both in full view --> all done return "YES"
    while (top folder is count 0)
        i_M++
    while (there is room)
        if i_N2 is not botoom
            move i_N2, and check against mail box in view
        else
            move skipped message back
            move i_N1
    while you can 
        move i_N1 --> skipping mail
```

# 22open

# prob1 visits

* It's a permutaion
A[i] : i -> A[i]

* the concept clique  a-> b-> c-> d-> a

```
Addup total moos
Find all cliques
for each cliques
    subtract the smallest moo
```

# prob2 subset
* Q is big, so only O(Q), or O(1) for each Q
* The other dim is small, ~26->N   O(N), O(N2)~10^2, O(N3)~10^4
* O(Q*N2)

Clues
* precheck all single letter question
* precheck all pair letter question
Think
Can we solve all questions with above pre-caculated list?
Conviction-->Yes

# prob3 COW operations
* Really hard if you have no clue
* Trivially easy once you grab the key

* Find mathematical invariance for all the trasformations
    * remove 2 of the same --> parity of any C, O, W does not change
    * replace 1 by the other two -> either take 1 add 1 or add 1 to both
* Let C, O, W represent the count of each letter
* The parity of C+O, C+W, O+W does not change

* What conditions are for C reducible C+O, C+W must be odd, O+W must be even
* Strategy
    * eliminate all W -> COOOCCCOO...
    * eliminate all pairs -> COCOC...C or OCO...COCO
    * OCO -> OOWO -> WO -> COO -> C : elimiates all the O's
    * works
    
```
for each Q
   find C, O, W of the substring in O(1)
   then check parity of C+O, and O+W
```
--> use prefix sum
