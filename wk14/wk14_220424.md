## prob1 silver: Closest Cow Wins
[2-index iteration, the idea of set]
[ x: patches, f: nemesis, ^ placement ] 
x x f x x ... x f x x x
   ^     ^       ^
--> sorted Plist[K] and Flist[M], need place N cows

```
i = 0  // tracks patch list
j = 0  // tracks the Flist
while i<K
   [do your logic]
   i++
```
* one cow can claim the end group of patches
* two cows can claim the middle group
      f x x x f
       ^     ^     --> T/2
* one cow can claim a subset of middle group
      f x[ x ]x f  --> max, T-max only when max > T-max  
           ^
 
Group_Set, push the group tastiness into a set, then just add-up the first N group

* The ideal is to take the first N groups
     it's either the case of G ... T/2, T/2
                          or G ....max, ....., T-max

## prob2 silver: Connecting 0 -> N-1
[backtracking -- dfs -- find regions]
* T totally independent sets
```
input T
for i=0:T
    solve the subset
```
* N, M -- N nodes, M edges --> a set of connected subgraphs
* Classic region find problem, use back tracking 
```
for i = 0:N
    if i not visited yet
        // use backtracking to find connected region that starts with i
        stack.push_back(i)
        while (stack.size()>0)
            node = stack.back()
            stack.pop_back()
            foreach j in adj_list[node]
               if j not in cach
                   push_back(j)
        // store region and continue           
```
* Strategy
  * 0-region -- The subgroup that connected to 0.
    * if N-1 is in 0-region, ans is 0  
  * (N-1)-region 
  * The distance is the smallest connection from point in one group to point in another group
  * find the dist between 0-region and (N-1)-region
    * if dist == 1, ans is 1
    * if dist == 2, ans is 2, idea is to use a middle point and add two connections
    * Generally, find a middle group, connect 0-group to it, connect (N-1) group to it, add up the cost
  * Idea:
    * start with 0, and (N-1), cost is dist*dist
    * foreach new region, add two connections, to 0-region and to-(N-1)-region, do we reduce the cost
        * if yes, commit, update the new minimum
  
 ## prob 3 - Convoluted Intervals
 --> prefix sum
 Try 1
 ```
  for i=0:N
      for j=i+1:N
         a = A[i] + A[j]
         b = B[i] + B[j]
         for k=a to b
             count[k]++
 ```
 --> O(N3)
 Try 2
 ```
 ..... a ....  b ....
       1 1 1 1 1
 ....... a'....  b'...
         1 1 1 1 1 
 ..... a ....  b ....
       1 1       -1 -1
```
* you only need store the count at endpoints of an interval
---> O(N2)

Try 3
```
for i=0:N
    A[i], B[i]
    count_A[A[i]]++
    count_B[B[i]+1]++
for i=0:M+1
    for j=i+1:M+1
        end_list[i+j] = count_A[i] * count_A[j]
        end_list[i+j+1] -= count_B[i] * count_B[j]
```

## prob 1 -- soul mate
* a, b -- the goal is a --> b, you can a*2, a+1, [a/2, (a+1)/2]
* simple case first -- a <= b, solve_ab_1(a, b)
```
long long solve_ab_1(a, b){
    extra = 0
    while a*2 < b
       a = a * 2
       extra++
       count++
    d = b - a
    for i = count downto 1
        effect_d = (1<<i)
        n = d / effect_d
        d -= n*effect_d
        extra += n
    return extra + d   
}

```
solve_ab(a, b) {
    if (a>b)
        if a % 2 == 0
            extra += 1
            a /= 2
        else
            extra += 2
            a = (a+1)/2
    // a <= b
    min = solve_ab_1(a, b)

       [do the divide]
       if min > solve_ab_1(a, b)
          min = solve_ab_1(a, b)
}
```

# prob 2 -- Cow friesbie

    a ..[x] .. b
      x < a && x < b
 * a < b, b is the first number on the right that is > a
 * a > b, a is the first number on the left that is > b     

* key idea is a list that is constantly ordered as we insert into it
    --> std::set or set::map
    
* let's insert the numbers from highest to lowsest
    N
    N (N-1)  or  (N-1) N   sum+=(i-j+1)
    ...
    
# prob 3 -- cereal

Graph 
* find subset of graph, solve each subgraph 
* for each subset, number of vertex (cereal) N, number of connection (cow) M
    * if M <= N, n_hungry = 0, do a tree iteration, you got it
    * if M > N, you have cycles, do a tree dfs on the graph starting at a cyclic node, n_hungry is the extra edges
