Backtracking

## problem
* a collection of nodes
*    nodes are randomly connected
* goal is to find some property
* Conclusion: the only way is to enumerate every possible node, and accumulate conclusions

--> Backtracking
* Need a stack (bag, container, vector, map, set, queue)
```
std::vector<int> stack;  // key is stack, it's flexible that stack can be *ANY* kind of containers.
```
* Need a cache (set, map, array) -- so that we avoid visiting the same node twice
* It's a while loop -- need check initialization, loop condition, and step function

* backtracking (with proper caching) is O(N) 

```
std::vector<int> adj[N]
```
```
std::vector<int> stack;
std::set<int> cache;

// initialization
// push the initial node
stack.push_back(0);
cache.insert(0)

while stack.size()>0   // <-- condition, the 2nd element of a while loop
    // pop, or taking the stone out of your back
    i = stack.back();
    stack.pop_back();
    
    // problem specific stats
    count = adj(i).count + 1
    if max < count 
       max = count
    
    // push some more stones from this stone
    foreach a in adj(i)  // * if linearly search all connections, that would be another O(M)
        if a not in cache
            stack.push_back(a)
// --- THAT's IT             
```

### prob 2 -- perimeter

* technique, use 1-D loop for 2-D grid
```
int grid[N*N]

i = k / N
j = k % N
```
```
while 1
    i_next =0
    while i_next<N*N && grid[i_next] == 0
        i_next++        
    if i_next == N*N
        break
    
    // -- initialize an empty region
    
    // find region starting at i_next
    std::vector<int> stack
    // grid is the cache
    
    stack.push_back(i_next);
    grid[i_next] = 0
    region.area++
    while stack.size()>0
        k = stack.back()
        stack.pop_back()
        i = k/N
        j = k%N
        int adj[4], int n_adj
        // populate adj, n_adj
        foreach k2 in adj(k)   // k-1, k+1, k-N, k+N -> for ii=0:n_adj -> adj[ii]
            if grid[k2] == '#'
                grid[k2] = 0
                stack.push_back(k2)
                region.area++
            else
                region.perimenter++
    push the region to region list            
    // THAT'S IT     
foreach region
    find max area, output area, perimeter
```
