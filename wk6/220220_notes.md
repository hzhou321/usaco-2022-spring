Week 6 - 1912

#1 FizzBuzz

 * count = N - N/3 - N/5 + N/15
     -> given count, binary search the N
 * every 8 maps to 15
 ```
    /* every 8 number maps to 15 */
    if N % 8 > 0
        N / 8 * 15 + dict[N%8]
    else
        (N / 8 - 1) * 15 + 14        
 ```   

#2 Meetings

 * identify the *invariant* -- the TIMING -- you know exactly at what time, what cow will stop
 * which cow hits barn first (can't do that directly)
    A ... x1 ... x2 ... ... x_2, x_1, ... B  --> needed to access weights
    StopTime_list[i] -> i'th cow with that direction will stop --> needed to access stop times
 * +1 group, -1 group
 * The first cow that hitting A is x1
 * COWs[], T[],  P[i] = i, -> sort P[] by T[i] -> P[i] -> ith cow in timing order 
 ```
 /* Permutation Sort */
 T[4] = 4, 2, 3, 1
 P[4] = 0, 1, 2, 3
 std::sort(P, P+4, [](a, b){
     return T[a]<T[b];
 });
 T[P[i]] -> time for ith cow
 ```

#3 milkvisits

 * It's a tree
 * Adj[i] -> vector of neighbors; Adj[a].push_back(b); Adj[b].push_back(a); --> O(1) access to all neighbors (vs. O(M))
 * Insight: it's a region finding problem
