a0-b0   a1-b1   ... a_n-b_n

* Very classical binary search problem pattern
```
long long d1 = 1
long long d2 = 1E18
while d1 <= d2
    d3 = (d1+d2)/2
    if works(d3)
       d1 = d3 + 1
    else
       d2 = d3 - 1
ans = d2       
```
```
int works(D)
    # put the first cow at far left, which is a0 -> x
    # if x+D in [ai, bi], x+D -> x
    # else  a_next -> x
```

# cereal

N cows M cereals

* first, you should be able to solve it directly using bronze method
```
Mlist[M]  initialize to all available (0)
foreach cow j   --> straight O(N)
    if Mlist[First[j]] == 0
        Mlist[First[j]] = 1
    else if Mlist[Second[j]] == 0
        Mlist[Second[j]] = 1
    else
        moo++
ans = N-i-moo        
```        
* O(N) * N

* Let's try the last question
```
Mlist[M]  --> avail -> -1,   i if cow i takes the cereal
for i=N-1 down to 1
   /* I will always take my first choice */
   if Mlist[First[i]] == 0
      Mlist[First[i]] == 1
   else 
      /* I am taking a choice of later cow (j) */
      j <- Mlist[First[i]]
      Mlist[First[i]] = i
      if Mlist[Second[j]] == 0
         Mlist[Second[j]] = j
      else if Mlist[Second[j]] > j
         then take it --> its a loop
      else
         moo++
      
  Ans[i] = N-i-moo
/* ---- Output --- */  
for i=0:N
   print Ans[i]
```

* Aha, that it is a connected graph problem, we are finding connected groups     
* The trick is, how to find connections, efficiently
    * Bronze method, foreach pair -> O(N2) -- Find all connections, and backtracking to find all groups 
    * We need efficient way of going through potential connections         
* What is a connections
     xi <= xj && yi <= yj
* Obviously we cannot sort all particles with both x, y
   * so let's do the next best thing -- sort by x
```
initialize groups[i] = {min:y_i, max:y_i}
while 1
    progress=0
    foreach groups
        if prev_min_y < this_max_y
            then merge the group --> g->{min_y} = MIN(both_group_min_y), so with max_y
            progress++
    if no_progress
        break
```
* What is the complexity
   -> Maximum N merges -> O(N)
