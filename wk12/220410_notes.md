## 1 Comfortable Cows

..x..
.xXx.
..O..

* We need avoid repeatedly query cows neighboring situations
    * we need some kind of map from cow's positiion -> neighboring situation
    * Some kind of encoding will help. 
        * k = x + y * 2000
        * W 1, E 2, N 4, S 8
        * map<int, int>

x x x x 
x x x x

 --> It's a *backtracking* algorithm

* N inputs -> N (Ox) -->     Straight simulation

## 3 Just Green Enough

-> count(100)
  0   1   0
  1   1   1
  0   1   1
->
  0   1   1
  1   2   3
  0   1   2
  
  row_counts[k] is the prefix sum for that row
  
* need two conditions
    1. Can't have cell < 100
    2. Need have a cell == 100
* How about just one condition
    1. Can't have cell < k  --> count(k)
    2. Ans is count(100) - count(101)
* New problem is to solve count(k) -> count subrect that all cells are >= k
    count(0) == all of them
    * (x1, x2, y1, y2)   (N+1)N/2 * (N+1)N/2
    * Do a row wise, then vertical
```
foreach (x1, x2)
    foreach contiguous_y_segment
        count += n * (n+1) / 2
```
