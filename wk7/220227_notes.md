int B[N];

int Basket[K];

2 3 4 6 8

A0 A1 A2 A3

A0 < A1 == A2 == A3

Let's say the maximum mid-basket is 4

2 3 4 6 8  ->
2 3 4 4 6  -> [threshold]
2 2 3 4 4  -> 
0 2 2 3 4  ->

4 4 4 4

Or you can do this:
2 3 4 6 8
2 3 0 2 0  + 4 full
0 0 2 2 3

Strategy: 
max = 0
for thresh = B[N-1] downto 0
    if (all K/2 baskets gets the thresh)
       continue if not
    simulate
    addup
    return max
    
You actually do not need simulate every loop   
  

In C++, you can use <set> (vs. unordered_set), also <map>
  >>>  Set.insert(i);  Map[key] = 1;
In Java, use TreeSet or TreeMap, (vs HashSet, HashMap)

Binary search X

Given X, 
for i = 0:K   K~10^12, 
    simulate
if remain==0
   return success
   
Need a formula instead of simulate   

One of the keys here is to realize it will not time out when X is small, every day it is making big progress, simulate is fine
But when X is large, you are paying smallnumbers every day (let's say 1) for consecutive days, so batch it.

What is the sorted state: P[i] = i
Every time adding 1 connection, you are joining the two set into one sorted set

Input
Sort the connections
Foreach connection from large to small
    if (all sorted)
        break
    join the two sets    
    
Question is -- how to effeiciently check sorted state, and efficiently join

Union-Join Algorithm  --> idea: every one remember their group leader (say the smallest in their group) 
Leader[N]

Initially: Leader[i] = i
Join(i, j) : Leader[j] = i  --> see why it's efficient? O(1)
How to navigate: O(lgN)
   int find_leader(i) {
       j = leader[i]
       while (leader[j] != j) {
           // leader[j] = leader[leader[j]]
           j = leader[j]
       }    
       return j
    }
    
How to check if all is sorted?
for i=0:N
    j = find(root)
    if (!is_sorted[j]) {
       return false
     }
 return true    
 
 Init:
     N_unsorted
     for i=0:N
         if (P[i] == i)
             is_sorted[i] = true
         else
             N_unsorted ++
             is_sorted[i] = false
 Remember the N_unsorted
    
The checking of all_sorted become O(1): if (N_unsorted == 0) -> true    
```
