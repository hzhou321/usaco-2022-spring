Week 11 -- 2101

#1 Dance Moves

* You have to simulate the first K
* end_postions[i]  cow i is at end_position[i] by the end of K swaps
* std::set<int> pos_list[N]
  
* E.g. cow 3 become the new cow 1, which means the set of cow 1 should be combined with the set of cow 3
--> we call these cows that a in a **cycle** a **clique*
  
#2 No Time to Paint 
  
* Build `std::vector<{a, b}> seg_list[26]`  -- O(N)
* You could try solve each Q independently, that is O(NQ), works for tests 1-7
* For full credit, need figure out how to work with the whole seg_list + gap  
  * That is not hard, just split each segment in half in O(1) time -- Can you?
  * The naive way is to linear search the segment list to find where the gap starts and end --> O(N)
  * So --> binary search

* Either determine by first row or by first column --> 2^N x 2 -- N~1000, won't work
* With row by row, each column is **independent**  --> 2 x N  -> O(N2)
